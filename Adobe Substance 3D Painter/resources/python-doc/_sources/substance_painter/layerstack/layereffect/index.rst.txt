Layers and effects
==================

Layers are top level elements of the layerstack or a group. Layers contain the painting and effects that will create the texture on the 3D object in the scene. Layers can be masked in order to display/apply their content only on specific parts of the texture.

Effects are a set of various actions that can be applied on the content or the mask of a layer. They allow an infinite series of changes from simple color variations to complex mask creations.
