Resources Definitions
=====================

The definitions of all the resources types available at runtime (Substance and MDL)
are generated by the unit test:

* ``%INSTALL_DIR%/resources/python/scripts/tests/test_sd/test_resource_definitions.py``

in the following file:

* ``%INSTALL_DIR%/resources/python/scripts/tests/assets/test_resource_definitions.txt``

They are also available below.
